###Arduino E200 Library

Arduino library made to interface an EBYTE E220 type module.

This library is mainly used for configuration of the modules parameters, sending and receiving data can be done with serial methods

This library was tested with and EBYTE-E220-900T-30D 850MHz-930MHz module

I have included example sketch code to demonstrate how to utilise the Library
